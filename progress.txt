I've gotten up to the point of sending the login requests and parsing cookies.

However, there is some issue with my login requests, which causes them to be invalid.

It doesn't appear to be EVENT_VALIDATION being borked, atleast not completely, as even if I use "old" values, I'm still logged in just fine, while completely invalid EVENT_VALIDATION inputs causes me to be redirected to some "An error occured" page from a browser, which does not occur when sending the request with node-fetch.

Maybe they have some sort of header validation that I don't know about, I can't see why it doesn't redirect me and log me in.

However, if you replace the session cookie with a valid, manual login cookie, it works like a charm, so it's only an issue with getting said valid cookie automatically.
